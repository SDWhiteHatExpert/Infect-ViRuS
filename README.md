If you're using a Windows system and want to run the script, you can use a Bash emulator or terminal emulator like Git Bash, Cygwin, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

No additional modules or dependencies are required beyond Bash itself to execute the Noob Name Virus script. Simply download the script from GitHub and run it using your Bash terminal. Remember to follow the warning provided earlier and use the script responsibly and ethically.
